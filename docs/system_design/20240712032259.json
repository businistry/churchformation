{"Implementation approach":"We will develop a Django-based web application to implement the tiered church formation services. Django provides a robust framework for building scalable web applications and includes built-in features for user authentication, database management, and admin interfaces. We'll use Django REST framework for API development, Celery for handling asynchronous tasks, and integrate with Stripe for payment processing. The application will be containerized using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.","File list":["manage.py","church_formation_project/","church_formation_project/__init__.py","church_formation_project/settings.py","church_formation_project/urls.py","church_formation_project/celery.py","services/","services/__init__.py","services/models.py","services/views.py","services/serializers.py","services/admin.py","services/tasks.py","resources/","resources/__init__.py","resources/models.py","resources/views.py","resources/serializers.py","resources/admin.py","consultants/","consultants/__init__.py","consultants/models.py","consultants/views.py","consultants/serializers.py","consultants/admin.py","users/","users/__init__.py","users/models.py","users/views.py","users/serializers.py","users/admin.py","templates/","static/","requirements.txt","Dockerfile","docker-compose.yml"],"Data structures and interfaces":"\nclassDiagram\n    class User {\n        +str email\n        +str password\n        +str first_name\n        +str last_name\n        +datetime date_joined\n        +bool is_active\n        +bool is_staff\n        +create_user(email: str, password: str, **extra_fields) User\n        +create_superuser(email: str, password: str, **extra_fields) User\n    }\n\n    class ServiceTier {\n        +str name\n        +str description\n        +float price\n        +bool is_full_service\n        +list[str] features\n    }\n\n    class ClientProject {\n        +User client\n        +ServiceTier service_tier\n        +str project_name\n        +datetime start_date\n        +str status\n        +JsonField progress\n        +start_project()\n        +update_progress(step: str, status: str)\n        +complete_project()\n    }\n\n    class Resource {\n        +str title\n        +str description\n        +str file_type\n        +str file_url\n        +list[str] tags\n        +bool is_premium\n    }\n\n    class Consultant {\n        +User user\n        +str specialization\n        +text bio\n        +float hourly_rate\n        +bool is_available\n    }\n\n    class Appointment {\n        +Consultant consultant\n        +ClientProject project\n        +datetime start_time\n        +datetime end_time\n        +str status\n        +schedule()\n        +cancel()\n        +complete()\n    }\n\n    class Payment {\n        +User user\n        +float amount\n        +str stripe_charge_id\n        +datetime timestamp\n        +str status\n        +process_payment()\n        +refund()\n    }\n\n    User \"1\" -- \"*\" ClientProject\n    ServiceTier \"1\" -- \"*\" ClientProject\n    User \"1\" -- \"1\" Consultant\n    ClientProject \"1\" -- \"*\" Appointment\n    Consultant \"1\" -- \"*\" Appointment\n    User \"1\" -- \"*\" Payment\n","Program call flow":"\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant C as Client\n    participant V as Views\n    participant M as Models\n    participant S as Serializers\n    participant T as Tasks\n    participant P as Payment Gateway\n\n    C->>V: Register user\n    V->>M: User.create_user()\n    M-->>V: User instance\n    V-->>C: Registration confirmation\n\n    C->>V: Login\n    V->>M: User.authenticate()\n    M-->>V: User instance\n    V-->>C: Login confirmation\n\n    C->>V: Get service tiers\n    V->>M: ServiceTier.objects.all()\n    M-->>V: ServiceTier queryset\n    V->>S: ServiceTierSerializer(queryset)\n    S-->>V: Serialized data\n    V-->>C: Service tier list\n\n    C->>V: Select service tier\n    V->>M: ServiceTier.objects.get()\n    M-->>V: ServiceTier instance\n    V->>M: ClientProject.objects.create()\n    M-->>V: ClientProject instance\n    V->>P: Process payment\n    P-->>V: Payment confirmation\n    V->>M: Payment.objects.create()\n    M-->>V: Payment instance\n    V-->>C: Project creation confirmation\n\n    C->>V: Access resources\n    V->>M: Resource.objects.filter()\n    M-->>V: Resource queryset\n    V->>S: ResourceSerializer(queryset)\n    S-->>V: Serialized data\n    V-->>C: Resource list\n\n    C->>V: Request consultant appointment\n    V->>M: Consultant.objects.filter()\n    M-->>V: Consultant queryset\n    V->>M: Appointment.objects.create()\n    M-->>V: Appointment instance\n    V->>T: send_appointment_notification\n    T-->>V: Task scheduled\n    V-->>C: Appointment confirmation\n\n    C->>V: Update project progress\n    V->>M: ClientProject.objects.get()\n    M-->>V: ClientProject instance\n    V->>M: ClientProject.update_progress()\n    M-->>V: Updated instance\n    V-->>C: Progress update confirmation\n","Anything UNCLEAR":"The original requirements do not specify the exact features for each service tier. It would be helpful to have a detailed breakdown of what each tier (Self-service, Standard, Premium, Elite) includes in terms of resources, consultant access, and other features. Additionally, information on the expected user roles (e.g., admin, consultant, client) and their permissions would be beneficial for implementing a more precise access control system."}
