Use Django's built-in authentication system for user management.\n2. Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for API authentication.\n3. Use Django REST framework for building RESTful APIs.\n4. Implement Celery for handling asynchronous tasks like sending notifications.\n5. Use Stripe for payment processing.\n6. Implement Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and easy deployment.\n7. Use PostgreSQL as the database backend.\n8. Implement proper permissions and access control for different user roles (admin, consultant, client).\n9. Use Django's admin interface for backend management.\n10. Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the application.","Anything UNCLEAR":"1. The exact features for each service tier (Self-service, Standard, Premium, Elite) are not specified. It would be helpful to have a detailed breakdown of what each tier includes in terms of resources, consultant access, and other features.\n2. The specific user roles (e.g., admin, consultant, client) and their permissions are not clearly defined. This information would be beneficial for implementing a more precise access control system.\n3. The project progress tracking mechanism for ClientProject is not clearly defined. More details on how progress should be updated and tracked would be helpful.\n4. The payment process and integration with Stripe need more clarification, especially regarding recurring payments for subscription-based tiers.\n5. The process for resource management, including uploading, updating, and deleting resources, needs more detailed requirements.\n6. The appointment scheduling process and any restrictions or rules (e.g., time slots, availability) need to be clarified.\n7. Any specific requirements for data backup, security measures, or compliance standards (e.g., GDPR) should be specified."}
