Project Title: Development of Tiered Service Offerings for Church Formation

Objective: To create a comprehensive set of service offerings that assist individuals and groups in starting a church. The services will include one self-service option and multiple full-service tiers, combining automated and manual processes to cater to different levels of need and budget.

Target Audience: The target audience includes individuals or small groups with limited budgets who prefer a DIY approach, as well as individuals or groups seeking comprehensive, hands-on assistance with minimal DIY effort.

Service Tiers:

The features include an online checklist and roadmap for the steps required to start a church, access to templates for Articles of Incorporation, bylaws, and board resolutions, step-by-step instructions for applying for an EIN online, detailed guides on conducting a SWOT analysis, drafting a mission statement, and creating a vision, and limited email support for general questions.
